# C4
*A fancy, real-time game using gunDB and React*

> This game is deployed on Heroku, and you can play it live [here](http://c4.gundb.io).

## Issues
Found a bug or have an idea? Submit it!

## Installing
If you want to try the game locally, here's how:

> You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

Clone this repo and install it's dependencies:

```sh
# clones the repo
git clone https://github.com/PsychoLlama/connect-four.git

# move into the newly created folder
cd connect-four

# install the dependencies
npm install
```

Now you can start the server locally by running

```sh
# or any port of your choice
npm start 8080
```

Now the game should be accessible by going to `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.

_**Optional:**_

If you want to edit the code, you'll need to run the build first. Kick it off with this:

```sh
npm run build
```

Now any changes you make should show up after refreshing your browser (no fancy hot-swapping :sob:).
